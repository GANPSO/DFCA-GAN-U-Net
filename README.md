**GAN.ipynb - _Image and Mask Generation with GAN_**
This notebook implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images and their corresponding masks. The GAN comprises a Generator (producing images and masks) and a Discriminator (distinguishing real vs. fake pairs). The generated images and masks are evaluated using a pre-trained U-Net model, achieving a Mean Dice Coefficient of 0.7534 and a Mean IoU of 0.6190.

**DFCA_GAN.ipynb - _Image and Mask Generation with DFCA-GAN_**
This notebook implements a Dynamic Feature Contextual Activation GAN (DFCA-GAN) to generate synthetic images and their corresponding masks. The DFCA-GAN enhances the generator and discriminator with DFCA modules, which dynamically scale features based on global context, improving the quality of generated images and masks. The generated outputs are evaluated using a pre-trained U-Net model, achieving a Mean Dice Coefficient of 0.8269 and Mean IoU of 0.7250. Additionally, the best-generated images and masks (with Dice > 0.90) are filtered, resulting in 724 high-quality pairs with a Mean Dice of 0.9890 and Mean IoU of 0.9786. 

**DFCA_GAN.ipynb - _U-NET Trained with ISIC 2016_**
This notebook implements a U-Net model for image segmentation, trained on the ISIC 2016 dataset (900 training images and 379 test images). The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, designed for precise segmentation tasks. The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and achieves a Mean Dice Coefficient of 0.8864 and Mean IoU of 0.8129 on the test set.

 _**•DFCA-U-Net Without Data Augmentation:**_ The model leverages the DFCA mechanism to enhance feature learning but is limited by the smaller dataset size.
 
 -Trained on the original ISIC 2016 dataset (900 training images and 379 test images). 
 
 -Achieves a Mean Dice Coefficient of 0.8959 and Mean IoU of 0.8283. 
 
 _**•DFCA-U-Net With Data Augmentation:**_ The addition of synthetic data significantly improves the model's performance, as evidenced by higher Dice and IoU scores. The DFCA mechanism, combined with augmented data, enhances feature learning and generalization, making it more robust for segmentation tasks.
 
 -Augmented with 724 synthetic images generated by DFCA-GAN, resulting in 1624 training images (379 test images). 
 
 -Achieves a Mean Dice Coefficient of 0.9010 and Mean IoU of 0.8323.

**Best_generated_images_and_masks.rar** This archive contains 724 ynthetic image-mask pairs generated using DFCA-GAN. These were selected based on Mean Dice > 0.90 and Mean IoU > 0.97, ensuring high segmentation accuracy.
